Alien Trees (by Pilcrow)
========================

This is intended as a simple reference mod, but it's fully useable if you want
it in your main world. One thing to note: the fruit is spikey and damages you!

It contains:
* code for generating a simple tree using set_node
* an example ABM for making saplings grow into trees
* code for spawning trees when new chunks load
* a special function for making new nodes based on old ones
